## Introduction

Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. This repository covers the key aspects of Docker, providing examples and instructions on how to effectively use Docker in your projects.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To begin using Docker, you'll need to install Docker Desktop on your machine. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Basic Commands

Here are some of the basic Docker commands you should know:

- **`docker run`**: Run a container from an image.
- **`docker build`**: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
- **`docker ps`**: List running containers.
- **`docker stop`**: Stop a running container.
- **`docker rm`**: Remove a stopped container.
- **`docker rmi`**: Remove an image.

## Dockerfiles

### Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
